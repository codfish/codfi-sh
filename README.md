Final Assignment
================

Here's your class assignment for the final project.

**Assignment:** Build a Hosted URL Shortener Service

**Due:** 6/30 at the latest

A URL shortener service allows users to create short redirect URLs from very long URLs. For example, Bit.ly will shorten https://github.com/generalassembly/ga-ruby-on-rails-for-devs as http://bit.ly/whjfQ0.

The minimal set of features is:
-------------------------------

- An anonymous user should be able to shorten a URL by entering it on the site. Using this URL redirects the browser to the destination URL.
- Users can register and shorten URLs. Registered users can see all the URLs they have shortened.
- Users can see a page with the number of times someone has used their short URLs, most popular URL first.
- The site has a public page with the number of times someone has used any of the short URLs, most popular URL first.
- The implementation must be Ruby on Rails, be committed to Github and the service has to run on Heroku. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.
